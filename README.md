This project is all about creating a model that can predict customer churn for a particular company or industry. The main idea is to gather and study data on customer behavior and characteristics to predict which customers might leave in the future. The ultimate aim is to assist businesses in recognizing and keeping customers who are at risk of leaving, thus lowering churn rates and increasing revenue. The project is aimed at companies in various sectors such as telecommunications, subscription services, SaaS, retail, and finance. Any business that depends on repeat customers can make use of customer churn prediction to enhance their retention tactics and maximize profitability.
